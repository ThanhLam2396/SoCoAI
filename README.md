#### Explanation:
**1. Data Collection**
The process starts by gathering data from multiple sources:
   - Social Media: Mainly from X (Twitter), which provides news, posts, and comments from crypto projects, dApps, and blockchain communities.
   -   Market Data: Retrieved through CoinGecko‚Äôs API, including key metrics such as MarketCap, trading Volume, total supply, current prices, All-Time High (ATH), percentage changes (daily, weekly, or monthly), inflation rates, and other market performance indicators.
   -   On-Chain Data: Sourced from Injective gRPC, injscan, and Cosmos platforms, including details like total supply, inflation rates, burned tokens, transaction volume, transaction speed (TPS - Transactions Per Second), staking amounts, staked asset value, active wallet count, smart contract activity, governance participation, block height, gas fees, and other blockchain performance metrics.
        
**2. Data Filtering**
   Raw data is filtered to remove unnecessary parts:
   -   Replies, quotes with no value, or content with sensitive keywords are discarded.
        
   -   Only reliable, ecosystem-relevant information is kept for further processing.
        
**3. Data Standardization (Transformation)**
    Filtered data is reorganized:
   -   Posts are structured consistently, edited for clarity, and credited with sources (author usernames) for transparency.
        
**4. Data Aggregation**  
    Standardized data is combined with pre-trained knowledge:
   -   This step merges new data with existing information and training to prepare for AI processing.
   -   Data is also stored in a database and storage system for future use.
        
**5. AI Processing** 
This is the core stage where SoCoAI turns transformed data into useful insights using Large Language Models (LLMs). The LLMs process natural language tasks‚Äîtokenizing, embedding, and analyzing context to extract meaning. Then, deep learning algorithms summarize content, analyze trends from quantitative data, and generate chatbot responses through inference.
    
**6. Output Based on Functions**  
   Depending on the need, SoCoAI produces results like:
   -   News recaps about dApps and ecosystems;
   -   Market trend analysis and dApp evaluations based on on-chain data;
   -   Responses to user comments and automated KOL interactions;     
   -   Smart chatbot replies based on user questions.  
        These outputs are shared on X, Telegram, and Discord for easy community access and stored in Google Sheets or databases for reporting and analysis later.
