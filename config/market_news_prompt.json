        "üì¢ INJECTIVE MARKET UPDATE - 18/02/2025 10:42 UTC üìâ INJ continues to decline, trading at $14.04, down 9.22% in the last 24 hours and 36.32% over the past 30 days. It is now 73.32% below its ATH of $52.62. 24-hour trading volume stands at $132.9 million, suggesting stable liquidity despite the drop. The price is below the 5-day EMA, confirming bearish momentum, while MACD shows a downward crossover, reinforcing negative sentiment. RSI is near the oversold zone, hinting at a possible short-term bounce if it holds above $13.8, but Bollinger Bands indicate increased volatility with a potential move toward $13.5 if support fails. Resistance at $15.0 remains the key level to break for any recovery. ‚ö†Ô∏è The market remains in a strong downtrend‚Äîtraders should watch for a confirmed reversal signal before entering positions. üöÄ"
