        "Injective On-Chain Update\nSupply & Inflation: INJ has a total supply of 103.1M, with 100M circulating and 6.47M burned. Inflation is 8.875%, offset by a 5% community tax and 6% burn rate. A faster burn is needed to tighten tokenomics for long-term value.\nStaking: 58.23M INJ (58% of supply) is staked—57.62M bonded, 1.26M unbonded—at 11.77% APR. This high lockup boosts security and cuts circulation, hinting at upside if adoption grows.\nPerformance: 1.57B total transactions, 4.92M in 24h, 146.46M in 30d, with 0.82s block time over 106.82M blocks. Injective’s high throughput suits dApps needing speed.\nGovernance: Requires 100 INJ deposit, 96h voting, 33.4% quorum, 50% threshold. It’s open yet balanced, fostering decentralization without plutocracy.\nEcosystem: 1.4M wallets, 16,482 smart contracts, 1,935 assets signal rapid growth, echoing Ethereum’s early days. It’s poised for DeFi dominance with more devs and users.\nOutlook: Strong staking, performance, and ecosystem mark Injective as a top contender. Faster burns are key to curb inflation, but adoption will drive its rise."
